# hello-world
my 1st repository
Hi people,
im learning git.
it is an initial stage.
and im learning from Github guides.
and imn following what the instructions in the guide say.
and i've just learned to create the branch.
and hererafter iam writing what iam learning each day.
so the list goes like this:
1) creating a depository
2) Creating branches

so i've created pull request for the branch readme-edits and merged the same to the main.
and further created another branch named first-edit.
another thing i read today is saved changes in git are called as commit.
each commit has an associated messages, which is a description explaining why a particular change has made.
